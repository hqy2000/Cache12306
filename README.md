# Cache12306

This is the old backend for [ChinaEMU](https://github.com/hqy2000/ChinaEMU). It would cache any queries sent to 12306 so that anti-spider would less likely to be triggered. This was abandoned due to the intention to reduce the number of servers used for the app. The app now makes direct requests to 12306.
